- Legislative - Responsible for creating the rules (laws) by which the name functions. In our MVN this means creating and modifying laws. ( A law is just a plain text referenced by a hash/link to ipfs.)

- Judiciary - responsible for enforcing the rules. In our MVN will be responsible for mediation: removing citizens and canceling laws.
